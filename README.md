### Project Setup

Super smash match is a game with 18 cards face down (9 pairs) and the player has to try to match all 9 pairs of matching cars by remembering the position of the cards.
Once the player matches 2 cards they will remain displayed facing up. Once all cards are matching a modal will appear notifying the player that they have won the game.
Upon exiting the modal the game will reset and re-scramble the cards in different positions.  Stats are tracked logging how many attempts, matches, and percentage of attempted matches actually matched.
